# Customer-purchase-prediction

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that will increase the profit of the marketing campaign of a fictional company. In order to achieve this, several techniques were applied regarding data preprocessing, feature engineering and Machine Learning models. The result should be a model that will allow the company to perform targeted marketing to customers that are likely to accept the campaign, leaving out the remaining non-respondents.
